Use the pr-description-generator agent to analyze my current branch and create a comprehensive pull request description following our repository's template.

Be thorough and complete, but prioritize clarity and organization. Reviewers appreciate concise descriptions, but not at the expense of missing important technical details.

Key requirements:
- Analyze actual file diffs, not just commit messages
- Categorize changes logically (features, fixes, infrastructure, code quality)
- Highlight configuration and tooling improvements separately
- Be specific with technical details (file paths, properties, plugin configurations)
